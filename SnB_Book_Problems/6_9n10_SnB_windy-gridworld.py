# Exercise 6.9: Windy Gridworld with King’s Moves (programming) Re-solve the windy
# gridworld assuming eight possible actions, including the diagonal moves, rather than four.
# How much better can you do with the extra actions? Can you do even better by including
# a ninth action that causes no movement at all other than that caused by the wind? ⇤
# Exercise 6.10: Stochastic Wind (programming) Re-solve the windy gridworld task with
# King’s moves, assuming that the e↵ect of the wind, if there is any, is stochastic, sometimes
# varying by 1 from the mean values given for each column. That is, a third of the time
# you move exactly according to these values, as in the previous exercise, but also a third
# of the time you move one cell above that, and another third of the time you move one
# cell below that. For example, if you are one cell to the right of the goal and you move
# left, then one-third of the time you move one cell above the goal, one-third of the time
# you move two cells above the goal, and one-third of the time you move to the goal.
